# Bank Tech Test

This challenge is to produce the requirements of the Bank Tech Test using TDD
and other stuff like that! 

## Scope and functionality
* There will not be a database implementation
* There will not be a user interface
* Inputs will be mocked and illustrated through the tests (I think)

* Simplecov will be used for test coverage
